#Specifies the JVM arguments used for the Gradle Daemon. The setting is particularly useful for

# When set to true, this will force Gradle to execute tasks in  parallel as long as those tasks are

# For Gradle to know exactly how to build your app, the build system configures all modules in your
# project, and their dependencies, before every build
# â€”
# even if you are building and testing only a single module. This slows down the build process for
# large multi-module projects. Setting this field will make Gradle attempt to configure only
# necessary projects.

# When set to true, this will force Gradle to not run a task if its inputs and outputs are
# equivalent to what they were during its previous execution.

# When set to true, Gradle will reuse task outputs from any previous build, when possible.
